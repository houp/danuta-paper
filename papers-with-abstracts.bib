We frame and solve this problem in the context of incomplete observations, i.e., prerecorded, incomplete configurations of the system at certain, and unknown time stamps. We consider 1-D, deterministic, two-state CAs only. An identification method based on a genetic algorithm with individuals of variable length is proposed.

The focus lies on legal outer-totalistic ACCAs, an interesting class of dynamical systems that exhibit some behavior that is not observed in the binary case. A unique combination of computer simulations (sometimes quite advanced) and a panoply of analytical methods allows to lay bare the dynamics of each and every one of these continuous cellular automata. The results also show that in the class of ACCAs considered, all types of sensitivity can be observed: sensitivity to a change of the number of cells in the grid, sensitivity to slight changes in the parameters of a local rule and sensitivity to the change of a single value in an initial configuration.}

Each cell of the grid is either empty or contains a particle. In subsequent time steps the particles move between the cells, but in one cell there can be at most one particle at a time. In this paper, the von Neumann neighborhood is considered, which means that in each time step a particle can move to an adjacent cell only. It is proven that regardless of the dimension d, all of these cellular automata are trivial, as they are intrinsically one-dimensional. Thus, for given d, there are only 4d+1 binary number-conserving cellular automata with the von Neumann neighborhood: the identity rule and the shift and traffic rules in each of the 2d possible directions.}

These automata, called number-conserving or density-conserving cellular automata, are of particular interest to mathematicians, computer scientists and physicists, as they can serve as models of physical phenomena obeying some conservation law. We propose a new approach to study such cellular automata that works in any dimension $d$ and for any set of states $Q$. Essentially, the local rule of a cellular automaton is decomposed into two parts: a split function and a perturbation. This decomposition is unique and, moreover, the set of all possible split functions has a very simple structure, while the set of all perturbations forms a linear space and is therefore very easy to describe in terms of a basis. We show how this approach allows to find all number-conserving cellular automata in many cases of $d$ and $Q$. In particular, we find all three-dimensional number-conserving CAs with three states, which until now was beyond the capabilities of computers.}

Moreover, it allows to find all such cellular automata with six and seven states, while so far, even enumerating six-state rules was beyond the reach of computing machines. Such enumeration allows us to revisit some unresolved questions in the field. Furthermore, we give some rough estimates of the asymptotic growth of the number of such cellular automata with n states, as n tends to infinity. The results are obtained for finite square grids with periodic boundary conditions, but they are also valid in the case of the infinite square grid.}

It is known that if the number of states k is smaller than or equal to six, then each rotation-symmetric number-conserving cellular automaton is isomorphic to some k-ary one, i.e., one with state set {0,1,...,k-1}.

In this inverse problem, one is looking for a cellular automaton that can classify each initial configuration into one of two classes according to its parity. In the case of deterministic one-dimensional cellular automata, there exists a local rule that effectively solves the parity problem, but it is unknown whether it is the simplest possible rule. Specifically, it is known that a cellular automaton with a nine-cell neighborhood can solve the parity problem, whereas no cellular automaton with a five-cell neighborhood is capable of doing so. These findings have remained unimproved for the past 10 years. In this paper, we present novel tools that allow to narrow down the existing gap.

      abstract={Determining properties of an arbitrary binary sequence is a challenging task if only local processing is allowed. Among these properties, the determination of the parity of 1s by distributed consensus has been a recurring endeavour in the context of automata networks. In its most standard formulation, a one-dimensional cellular automaton rule should process any odd-sized cyclic configuration and lead the lattice to converge to the homogeneous fixed point of 0s if the parity of 1s is even and to the homogeneous fixed point of 1s, otherwise. The only known solution to this problem with a single rule was given by Betel, de Oliveira and Flocchini (coined BFO rule after the authors' initials). However, three years later the authors of the BFO rule realised that the rule would fail for some specific configuration and proposed a computationally sound fix, but a proof could not be worked out. Here we provide another fix to the BFO rule along with a full proof, therefore reassuring that a single-rule solution to the problem really does exist.},

  abstract     = {We study three-dimensional rotation-symmetric cellular automata with the von Neumann neighborhood that conserve the sum of states. We show that any non-trivial such automaton requires at least seven states, which agrees with intuition based on the known results for the one and two-dimensional cases. We also give a full characterization of these cellular automata with a seven-element state set and the result is quite surprising.},

  abstract     = {The density classification problem is one of the most studied problems in the context of the computational abilities of cellular automata. Since this problem cannot be solved in the classical sense, we consider a weaker version, by slightly relaxing the assumptions on the output specification. In this paper, we discuss this relaxed problem for two-dimensional Affine Continuous Cellular Automata (ACCAs). We focus on finding the most performant rules solving this problem among the density-conserving ones by evaluating ACCAs experimentally for a predefined set of initial configurations.},

In this paper we propose a novel, relaxed variant of this task, namely the $\alpha$--DCT, which could be solved with the use of the Continuous Cellular Automata (CCAs). The paper is accompanied with the presentation of the results of simulations utilizing evolutionary algorithm for constructing CCA--based solutions of the $\alpha$--DCT.}
