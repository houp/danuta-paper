  abstract = {The parity problem, in its classical formulation, is to find a CA that can properly classify each initial configuration into two classes according to its parity: if the initial configuration contains an odd number of 1s then the global state of the grid should converge to the fixed point of all 1s; otherwise, i.e., if the initial configuration contains an even number of 1s then the global state of the grid should converge to the fixed point of all 0s. This problem appears to be much harder than the DCP because the output is altered simply by a flip in any one of the input bits. Moreover, according to the formulation of the problem, it is immediately obvious that it has no sense for even-sized grids (see, for example, [1]). For this reason, the solution to this problem is considered to be a CA (actually: a local rule f), which correctly classifies all configurations of odd length. It turns out that the parity problem has a solution. In [1] Betel et al. described the local rule with radius 4 (i.e., the size of the neighborhood is equal to 9), called BFO rule, that solves the parity problem. The BFO rule was constructed by analyzing the properties of the De Bruijn graph of the rule, that preserves parity and converges correctly for any initial configuration to a homogeneous configuration. In the same paper it was shown that there is no binary CA with radius at most two (i.e., for neighborhood size not greater than 5) that would solve the parity problem for all odd-sized grids. They also leave open the question of whether there is a rule of radius 3 (i.e., with a neighborhood size of 7) that solves the parity problem. They attempted to find the perfect rule using a sophisticated evolutionary algorithm. After many trials, they made the following conjecture: Conjecture 1 The perfect solution to the parity problem with the neighborhood of size 7 does not exist. Although the results presented in [1] are magnificent, the authors have left a fairly wide gap, because the paper does not contain any results for neighborhoods of size 6, 7, or 8. Today, 10 years after publication, the results have still not been improved and the gap has not been narrowed. [1] H. Betel, P. P. Oliveira, and P. Flocchini.

For this reason, they are a very graceful object for study: any theoretical result can usually be expressed in terms of the interactions between the particles.

  abstract     = {The parity problem is a classic benchmark for the testing of the computational power of cellular automata. In the traditional formulation, the problem involves cyclic configurations of odd length, which should converge to a fixed point of all 0s or all 1s based on the initial number of 1s, without global access to the sequence. We are interested in exploring a kind of “halfway solutions", i.e., CAs that correctly classify all even configurations or all odd configurations. In particular, we are interested in whether there is a local rule solving the one-side parity problem that is less complicated (i.e. has a smaller neighborhood size) than the local rules solving the classical problem.}
